# Netflix Clone Auth

## Project Overview

This project is a Netflix clone built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **jQuery** for the frontend, along with a backend that handles user authentication including login and registration. The application mimics Netflix's user interface and user experience for authentication workflows.

After successful login, users are redirected to a Netflix-style homepage that displays a list of movies with an option to add them to favorites. Currently, the project does not support actual movie streaming; the focus is on UI, authentication, and basic movie management features.

## Features

- User registration with validation  
- User login with session handling  
- Backend storage of user credentials  
- Netflix-like homepage UI after login  
- Movie display grid with "Add to Favorites" functionality  
- Responsive design with clean layout
